                    SoftUni and "Software University"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SoftUni is one of the largest and most respected educational institutions, creating professionals in
                    the fields of software engineering, digital marketing and design. Today SoftUni works directly with
                    more than 70 IT companies and has an active community of 150 000 students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2013, with its unique concept and innovative educational methodology, SoftUni is rapidly
                    becoming a market leader and today organizes hundreds of training programs, free courses and
                    webinars, events and other educational initiatives that provide quality education to thousands of
                    young people in the field of IT and digital technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With its foundation in 2013, SoftUni starts its first and most successful project - the "Software
                    University" - a unique educational initiative which creates high-quality software engineers from
                    scratch, achieving incredible success rate - 97% of all graduates successfully start their career as
                    software engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Software University" is a project of SoftUni and is not among the state recognized universities,
                    because the purpose of "Software University" is to be their alternative, providing their students
                    with everything they need to start their career!
