                    It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and
                    multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the
                    World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web
                    applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated
                    JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
                    functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It
                    has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the
                    DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics
                    facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>
