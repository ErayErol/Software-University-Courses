SINGLE RESPONSABILITY - a class should not have more than one reason to be changed!!!
	-Each task maps a single code unit
	-A method should do one operation
	-A class should represent one entity
	Strong Cohesion / Loose Coupling 
	Small number of instance variables inside a class
	Each method of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables
	Two modules should exchange as little information as possible
	Creating an easily reusable subsystem 

OPEN/CLOSED - to expand the functionality of a class without change it- using  interfaces etc.!!!
	-Extensibility 
	Adding a new behavior doesn’t require changes over existing source code
	-Reusability  
	subsystems are suitable for reusing in other projects – modularity
	Parameters 
 	Control behavior specifics via a parameter or a delegate
		Rely on abstraction, not implementation
	Inheritance / Template Method Pattern
	Strategy Pattern
	Plug in model (insert a new implementation of the interface)
	By experience – know the problem domain and if a change is very likely to recur
	New domain problem – implement the most simple way
	Changes once – modify, second time – refactor
	TANSTAAFL – There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch
	OCP adds complexity to design
	No design can be closed against all changes - know which onesto guard

LISKOV SUBSTITUTION - to not inherit and change the logic of a base class 
by overriding methods used in the base constructor etc

INTERFACE SEGREGATION - do not construct a fat interfaces or methods who have many responsibility,
 because in case of inheritance you may have properties than you don't need to use

DEPENDANCY INVERSION - make all dependencies to be given from outside the class,
 do not implement their logic in the class
