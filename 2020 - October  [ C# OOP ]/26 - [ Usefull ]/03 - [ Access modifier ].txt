Public Class - you can call this class and his public properties and methods everywhere in the solution
- if you have a protected method/property set/ in the public class - this protected method is unaccessible

Internal Class- you can use this class everywhere  in your current project
- not a good practice to make some propery of a child class internal, because it's not protected 

Sealed Class/Method/Property of base class - you can not make child classes if the base class is sealed, 
prevents other classes from inheriting from it and prevents the ovverriding of specific virtual methods and properties

Private - just for this class
Protected - can be used from current class and every his child classes
- you don't need a protected set in a sealed class, because noone can inherit this class

Constructors - if your base class have a constructor with parameters /not empty constructor/,
 you are obligate to reuse in the child class the constructor of the base class 
- Base class Person with constructor(string name) - child class Student have to use -
constructor (string name) : base(name) or empty constructor with : base(string.Empty)

Public virtual Method/property/ in a base class - every child classes cam override this method 

Extended class  have to be static with static methods

The Abstract class is a class that can not be initialize /like Animal/ 
- in the abstract class we can write an abstract methods /they return nothing, 
but they can be used to override it in the child classes
